# GAMERDLE - IN PROGRESS
A themed wordle clone.

## Current vs Future State
The game is currently playable. A correct answer is randomly selected and the guess data is properly dislayed.  
Gamerdle could still use UI upon success/failure of a round, as well as a loop to a new game from the end of the round. (Currently the only way to start a new game is to reload the page.)  
Expanding the dictionary would make for more interesting gameplay.  

## Word Data
The word data used in GAMERDLE is pulled from many different games. 
There's not a consistent game genre (unless you count "Games the Dev Has Played" as a genre). 
They are all popular games, and I tried to pick well known terms from those games.

### Current Included Games:
- Valorant
